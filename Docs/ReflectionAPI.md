# The LuaMachine Reflection API

While 'safety' of scripting api exposure is one of the main objective of LuaMachine, sometimes accessng the reflection api of Unreal Engine 4 is pretty useful (and often a quickway for exposing scripting when you are not worried about giving too much power to users)

Albeit the api is usable from blueprints, it is strongly suggested to go to C++ when defining more advanced states.
